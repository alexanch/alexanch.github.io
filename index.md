My name is Oleksandr, I am an ML engineer currently developing a web app for visual search/match of clothing in Paris. 
<br /><br />
I have 2 years of experience working on a range of computer vison tasks applying classical ML and DL, from research to production.
<br /><br />
Originally coming from an Applied Physics background, I found my passion for ML/DL and CS during my studies at [Erasmus + Joint Master Degree COSI (Color in Science and Industry)](https://cosi-master.eu/cosi-master-degree/) focused on a strong collab with research institutions and industrial partners in ML and imaging field. 
<br /><br />
I studied and worked abroad in four different countries and got to experience research and development from different cultures.
<br /><br />
Passionate about photography and fashion. Some links to explore my life out of studies: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_alexanch/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79361670-alex-boiko), [500px](https://500px.com/alexanch), and [Lookbook](https://lookbook.nu/alexanch).
<br /><br />

Some random facts about me: <br />
ðŸ“Œ  My primary programming language is Python and usual Python stack(Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib).<br />
ðŸ“Œ  My favorite deep learning framework is fastai (efficient PyTorch wrapper), half of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on were built on TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.<br />
ðŸ“Œ  Tools that I use often: docker, Github. For cloud computing, I prefer GCP, although I worked with AWS too.<br />
ðŸ“Œ  During my free time, I am expanding my knowledge in the field by attending meetups/conferences/doing consulting/online education/hackatons.<br /><br />

Feel free to reach out, let's talk life :)

My name is Oleksandr, I am a recent graduate student from [Erasmus + Joint Master Degree COSI (Color in Science and Industry)](https://cosi-master.eu/cosi-master-degree/).
<br /><br />
My specialties are Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Computational Imaging, and Color Science.
<br /><br />
Currently, developing an AI-powered web app that finds luxury item alternatives from fast-fashion retailers. The idea is to use ResNet CNNs to generate fashion embeddings for a beloved fashion piece and compare them to embeddings stored in the database, finding the most similar ones.
<br /><br />
I have experience working on computer vision tasks using classical and deep learning methods in both industrial ([Olympus Corp., Japan](https://www.olympus-global.com/), [Vilmorin, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilmorin)) and academia fields ([SIB Labs, Finland](https://www.uef.fi/web/siblabs/color-research-laboratory)).
<br /><br />
I graduated from three universities ([UJM, France](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html), [UEF, Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en/etusivu), [UGR, Spain](https://www.ugr.university/)) in 2 years. In addition, I am [MSc in Applied Physics and Nanomaterials](http://www.univ.kiev.ua/en/departments/ht/).
<br /><br />
Was awarded by 3 MSc diplomas by:
1. [University Jean Monnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet_University), (member of [University of Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/indexation/structures-affiliees-lens-et-partenaires/universite-jean-monnet-saint-etienne)), France
2. [University of Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Granada), Spain
3. [University of Eastern Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Eastern_Finland), Finland.
<br /><br />
Also, I graduated from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv with the degree of MPhys with Honours in Applied Physics with technical experience in the field.
