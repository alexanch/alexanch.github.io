 <a href="https://doi.org/10.2352/issn.2169-2629.2019.27.53">[Article]</a><a href="/images/Boiko_poster_CIC.pdf">[Poster]</a>
</p>
<br />

<p><ul style='text-align: justify'>
  <li> Built a deep learning-based pipeline in Python, Keras, and TensorFlow to segment disease areas from
hyperspectral images of oral cavities reaching IoU segmentation score up to 0.92.</li>
  <li> Developed a real-time data generator for hyperspectral image augmentation; image segmentation and
visualization tools for hyperspectral images based on Unet and cloud computing.</li>
  <li> Published a first-author scientific paper which was awarded 2nd place for ”Best student paper award” (among approx. 200 participants).</li>
</ul></p><br />

<b>Automatic quality control of fruits and vegetables by surface color appearance in the growing stage</b>
</p>
{% include slider.html selector="slider2" %}
<!--<img src="/images/CC_optimized.gif" alt="color checker" align ="middle">-->
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Nu5uXwRr3iCe-a3O5BXwSXybrpC-L0MI">[Project]</a>
</p><br/>
<p><ul style='text-align: justify'>
  <li> Built a system for the automatic detection of a color checker in a natural environment under varying illumination with an accuracy of 96%.</li>
  <li> Applied color correction to exclude the effect of the camera and illuminant; evaluated the color correction accuracy.</li>
  <li> The project was awarded a prize as the best-proposed solution, suitable for use in the industry.</li>
  <li> Software: Matlab, Image Processing Toolbox.</li>
</ul></p><br />

<b>Counterfeit banknotes detection using Hyperspectral technologies in UV, visible and IR ranges</b>
</p>
{% include slider.html selector="slider3" %}
<!--<img src="/images/joint_proj_optimized.gif" alt="counterfeit detection" align ="middle">-->
<br /><br />
<p style='text-align: justify'>
<ul>
  <li>Captured hyperspectral images of real banknotes under different illumination (UV, VIS and IR ranges).</li>
  <li>Applied PCA, ICA to identify spectral bands with unique features.</li>
  <li>Developed a proof-of-concept solution for fake banknote detection based on detected features.</li>
  <li>Software: Matlab, Image Processing Toolbox.</li>
</ul></p><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/alexanch/3d-reconstruction-stereo-kinect">[Project]</a><br /><br />
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify'>
<ul>
  <li>Captured 3D scene by using a pair of Kinect V2 cameras.</li>
  <li>Combined RGB-D images to reconstruct the corresponding 3D scene.</li>
  <li>Software: Matlab, Image Processing Toolbox.</li>
</ul></p><br />

<p style='text-align: justify'>
During the project, our team developed a remotely controlled robotic system with cameras and lasers to map the Mars area and create the shortest route between the objects. Our team became a winner of the final competition, providing the most accurate mapping among other teams and reported the shortest route.<br /><br />
As a team leader, I was responsible for task management and team building between people from a different scientific and cultural backgrounds.

<p style='text-align: justify'>
During the project, our team developed a new business model related to Color Science Branch. The idea was to create a device which contains NIR spectrometer for evaluation of the true composition of medicine before consumption to avoid low-quality, fake or substandard pills.
