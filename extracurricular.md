  <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Conversational platforms change the way people expect to interact with the devices and services they use every day, but intellectual interaction is more than understanding simple commands. Our project is a proof-of-concept of a great interactive experience.
  <p/>
  <br />

  <b>SPEEDWAGON APP</b> can:<br />
  ○ Do real-time speech recognition  <br />
  ○	 Understand multiple pieces of information given in a single sentence <br />
  ○	 Process customer requests for classification to determine their needs <br />
  ○	 Ask questions of its own as a natural part of a conversation <br />
  ○	 Do real-time AR simulation of glasses or hat using video stream from Webcam <br />

  <br />
  <b>Technologies</b>: face recognition, word embeddings, word2vec, doc2vec, speech recognition. Python, TensorFlow, Flask, OpenCV.
