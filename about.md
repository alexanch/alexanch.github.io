My name is Oleksandr, I am a recent graduate student from [Erasmus + Joint Master Degree COSI (Color in Science and Industry)](https://cosi-master.eu/cosi-master-degree/).
<br /><br />
Currently, I am building an open-source web application that finds luxury item alternatives from the mass-market. The recommendation algorithm is based on ResNet CNNs used to generate fashion embeddings.
<br /><br />
My specialties are Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Computational Imaging, and Color Science.
<br /><br />
I have experience working on computer vision tasks using classical and deep learning methods in both industrial ([Olympus Corp., Japan](https://www.olympus-global.com/), [Vilmorin, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilmorin)) and academia fields ([SIB Labs, Finland](https://www.uef.fi/web/siblabs/color-research-laboratory)).
<br /><br />
I graduated from three universities ([UJM, France](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html), [UEF, Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en/etusivu), [UGR, Spain](https://www.ugr.university/)) in 2 years. In addition, I am [MSc in Applied Physics and Nanomaterials](http://www.univ.kiev.ua/en/departments/ht/).
<br /><br />
Passionate about photography and fashion. Some links to explore my life out of studies: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_alexanch/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79361670-alex-boiko), [500px](https://500px.com/alexanch), and [Lookbook](https://lookbook.nu/alexanch).

Hope you have a great day!
